# Simple Airgapped Docker Registry [WIP]

This docker-compose will quickly set up a Docker Registry with the following.
 - docker registry authentication container with sensible default ACL controls based on [docker_auth](https://github.com/Ouwen/docker_auth.git)
 - [official docker registry container](https://docs.docker.com/registry/) 
 - postgres container for storing users
 - (TODO) golang server for managing users
 - (TODO) react frontend

To run this stack, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Create your certs, replace the domain with your host machine domain
```
export MY_DOMAIN=localhost

openssl req \
  -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -sha256 -subj '/CN=*.$MY_DOMAIN/' -keyout ./certs/domain.key \
  -x509 -days 365 -out ./certs/domain.crt
```

### Step 2: Start the stack
```
	docker-compose up
```

## Optional Steps: 

### Add static users
In the `auth_config.yml` file. You can add static users by running
`htpasswd -nB my_password`. `htpasswd` can be installed by running
`sudo apt install apache2-utils`. A test user is added for example.

### Change DB string
The postgres database env is specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
This can be changed out to an already running database, and the postgres
server can be turned off.

### Change the data location of the registry by mounting a different volume
Default we mount `$PWD/data:/var/lib/registry`

### Change auth logging location
Default we mount it to `$PWD/logs:/logs`
